                    Binding Arbitration: Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any
                    question regarding its existence, validity or termination, which cannot be resolved by negotiation
                    shall be referred to and finally resolved by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
                    accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (including the Supplementary Procedures for
                    Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable). The number of arbitrators shall be three (3). The seat or
                    legal place of arbitration shall be the State of Virginia, USA. The language of the proceedings
                    shall be English Language. The governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of the
                    United State of America.
                    <br><br>
                    Restrictions: The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the
                    Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with
                    any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
                    class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for
                    any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
                    any other persons.
                    <br><br>
                    Exceptions to Arbitration: The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
                    above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
                    concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                    related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use;
                    and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
                    found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
                    personal jurisdiction of that court.
